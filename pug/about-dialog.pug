    h1 About Timetabler
    p
      | Timetabler is a tool designed to help you visualise your uni timetable
      | preferences while you choose them.
    p
      | It's a project essentially born out of frustration with the fact that
      | Allocate+ gives you nothing but a table of options per class when
      | considering your timetable, and seemly expects you to memorize all the
      | previous classes' options when you move on to the next one.
    p
      | This tool allows you to see all your current choices visually on one
      | timetable grid, and drag-and-drop blocks between options until you're
      | satisfied with your choices, which you can then export in case you want
      | to fiddle with them again later.
