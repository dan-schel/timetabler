# Timetabler
A tool to help choose options on a timetable where there might be multiple classes running!
Allows you to quickly select different time slots and checks for clashes for you as you go.

ðŸš§ Currently offline while moving to a new home.

## Providing your timetable
Timetables should be provided by creating a valid `.json` file. Timetabler will prompt you for this on startup.
The schema for this file is provided in [data-schema.json](data-schema.json), and an example data file can be found in [example-data/the-usual-classes.json](example-data/the-usual-classes.json).

**Note:** The `times` property is not supported yet, so times are currently restricted to 8am - 8pm. Times outside this shouldn't break the tool, but will get cutoff from the timetable view. Sorry!
